  "comments": {
    "profit_share": "I love this graph. We had our best month, which translates into our highest profit share. Congratulations. ",
    "customer_revenue": "Customer revenue increased significantly in January, driven primarily by strong Training Plan sales. Revenue from plans was up 42% year over year, reflecting continued momentum coming out of the prior quarter.\n\nRenewal revenue is also showing a steady, predictable increase. This is driven by two factors. First, we are selling more Training Plans, which naturally expands the renewal base over time. Second, we increased the renewal price several months ago for new customers only.\n\nAs a result, some legacy customers on lower-priced renewals naturally roll off and are replaced by renewals at the higher price point. This creates a gradual but durable lift in renewal revenue without disruption to the existing base.",
    "subscribers": "Only one metric needs explanation.\n\nJanuary churn was 8.22%, compared to a 6-month average of 6.93%. On the surface, that may look concerning, but it is expected and occurs consistently in months with strong sales.\n\nA portion of churn comes from what we call Immediate Cancels. These are customers who cancel Live Help before their first renewal. This behavior is normal and makes sense. Many customers know they need training but later decide they do not need ongoing Live Help.\n\nOver the lifetime of an average plan, the monthly churn rate is approximately 6.4%. But, it's not equal each month. The highest concentration of cancellations happens before the first billing.\n\nImmediate Cancels: ~14%\n\nOngoing churn after month one: ~5.7%\n\nAs a result, months with higher sales naturally show higher reported churn, driven by first-month behavior rather than deterioration in customer retention.",
    "traffic": "We're getting more people to our website! And, as I wrote last month, it's all about Paid Ads.\n\nThe big win is this; even as paid visitor volume increased significantly year over year, cost per click declined by 19%. That combination matters. It means we are not simply buying more traffic, but buying it more efficiently.",
    "refunds": "Great job here. Our 2.56% puts us in the Excellent tier.",
    "intuit_sales": "Historically, January is one of our strongest months because we record the quarterly sales (3 previous months) for Priority Circle. This January is no different, except for the addition of IES revenue, which basically doubled Intuit sales for January. IES sales continued its monthly growth, increasing from $123.5k (in December) to $154.5k (January).",
    "a_note_from_david": "January was the most profitable month we’ve ever had.\n\nThe primary reason is our team. We share a relentless focus on making things better, and that effort compounds over time. This month is clear proof of that. Well done.\n\nThere is also a seasonal factor. January is when many businesses either switch accounting systems or take a hard look at their books as they prepare for taxes. In both cases, that often leads them to seek training and help, which aligns directly with what we offer.\n\nI also want to talk about something bigger that’s shaping our work. Over the past year, our AI use has increased significantly. We’ve moved from exploring what AI can do, to actively using it across writing, coding, and workflow automation. The tools are improving quickly, and how we apply them is becoming a meaningful differentiator for us.\n\nMany of you have seen Jason’s work around Live Help, which has been exceptional. Aaron has built similar systems across website traffic, revenue, paid ads, and more. With the latest tools, we are now able to build complete workflows that automate routine tasks.\n\nWhen a task goes away because it has been automated, it’s natural to ask what that means. In our case, it means the task is gone, but the person remains. This way, we're able to shift everyone's focus to work that requires judgment, teaching, and real customer understanding.\n\nThis is why it’s important to stay aligned with our AI goals. Our competitive advantage has never been doing routine work well. It has always been the expertise and care we bring to helping customers learn and solve problems. The more we use AI to remove routine work, the more time and energy we can invest where it matters most: our customers.\n\nThis is also shaping how we think about our team and how we hire. We are investing in people who want to grow their skills, work closer to customers, and expand their impact over time. As routine operational work decreases, opportunities increase for those who lean into teaching, Live Help, and customer-facing work.\n\nAs always, thank you for the focus, effort, and care you bring to this work. January was a special month, and it reflects how this team is a Super Bowl winner!",
