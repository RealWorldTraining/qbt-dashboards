  "comments": {
    "profit_share": "December significantly outperformed last year, which is especially meaningful because December has historically been our slowest month. This wasn't a lucky month. It reflects the cumulative impact of how we operate.\n\nWhen asked what drove these results, the answer is simple but not superficial: the team. Not a single initiative, tactic, or shortcut, but our consistent focus on the customer and delivering a high-quality experience in everything we do. That discipline compounds, and December is a clear example of it paying off.",
    "customer_revenue": "The top graph shows sales over the past 24 months. We continue to grow our subscriber base, and the steady upward trend reflects that momentum.\n\nWhat drove the exceptional results is the strength of the Training Plans themselves. Last year\u2019s numbers included 2-day class sales, which were a more transactional, lower-commitment purchase. Even without that advantage, Training Plans significantly outperformed expectations; a strong signal that customers clearly see and value what we sell.",
    "subscribers": "The subscriber base continues to grow. A natural question is whether the base should be growing faster, given the increase in sales. The answer is shown in the table.\n\nSubscriber attrition is a normal part of our model. Our goal is for customers to become proficient enough in QuickBooks that they no longer need us. So, when someone cancels their Live Help, it's often a success, not a failure. And, other factors outside our control also contribute, such as customers changing accounting systems or business needs.\n\nWhat matters most is how well we manage that attrition. This is measured by our churn rate, and at 6.68%, it clearly falls in the excellent range.",
    "traffic": "The top graph shows the relationship between New Visitors and Paid Visitors. As we\u2019ve discussed, Google continues to push organic results further down the search results page, which increases the importance of paid ads.\n\nThe key is not whether we use paid traffic, but how efficiently we use it. Over the past year, we\u2019ve worked deliberately to reduce our cost per click (CPC), and those efforts paid off.\n\nThe result is that we\u2019re now able to acquire more highly qualified traffic for the same overall spend. That's a win.",
    "refunds": "Refunds and chargebacks naturally increase as sales volume increases. Some drivers are within our control, while others are not. While the ideal is zero refunds, that isn\u2019t realistic for any growing business.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note a timing mismatch: sales occur in one month, while related refunds or chargebacks often appear in a later month. As a result, monthly fluctuations can look more dramatic than they really are.\n\nThe more meaningful measure is how our refund and chargeback levels compare to similar companies. On that basis, our performance is excellent.",
    "intuit_sales": "The top graph shows Intuit sales over the past 24 months. For most of 2024 and early 2025, sales were fairly steady, with normal month-to-month swings driven largely by the timing of Priority Circle payments, which are billed quarterly.\n\nThe big change starts in July 2025. That\u2019s when Intuit made a contracted payment covering the first six months of the IES program. That initial payment was higher than what actual subscriber revenue would\u2019ve been at the time. In the months that followed, however, subscriber sales ramped quickly, which is why you see consistently higher revenue after July.\n\nThe net effect is a higher baseline. Since July, our monthly revenue has effectively moved up, and we\u2019re now consistently earning over $100K per month for IES alone. We also made a modest price increase to Priority Circle starting in July, which contributed a smaller portion of the overall increase.",
    "a_note_from_david": "I love what I do. It\u2019s fun, and sometimes it\u2019s genuinely hard. Things move quickly, and just keeping up with what truly matters can feel like a full-time job on its own. There is constant learning, constant change, and real pressure in the world right now.\n\nMany of you are feeling that firsthand. Some are teaching for the first time, which is stressful in all the right ways. You are learning the material, practicing delivery, and answering questions in real time, often while wondering if you are ready. That takes courage and effort.\n\nOthers are stepping into new roles while the work itself is evolving. Learning a new job is hard enough. Learning it while the expectations and systems are changing can feel like driving a race car at full speed while the track is being redesigned. That kind of growth is demanding, and it is not lost on me.\n\nThis is how I think about stress. Not all stress is bad. In many cases, stress shows up because we care deeply about what we are doing. The more something matters to us, the more weight it carries. Caring and responsibility often come with pressure attached.\n\nWhen I feel wiped out or unsure where the energy for the next push will come from, I try to zoom out and remember the bigger picture of what we do and who we are. We do meaningful work that genuinely helps people, and we get to do it alongside teammates who are thoughtful, capable, and great to work with. I am grateful for that more than I probably say out loud.\n\nWe had a fantastic December. Months like this one feel like a quiet reminder that the work we do every day matters to our customers. They value it. They trust it. And they are willing to pay for the time, care, and expertise we bring to it.\n\nThank you for the effort, focus, and care you bring to this work. It shows, and it matters.\n\nWhat follows is a walkthrough of how the month unfolded, section by section.",
    "expense_highlights": "Web Search Engines +20K\nWe continue to use Google Ads strategically to drive qualified traffic to the site. This spend is intentional and directly supports growth, though it does increase overall marketing costs.\n\nAccounting Fees +7K\nWe file tax returns in a large number of states, which adds complexity and cost. These fees reflect the work our CPAs\nperform to keep us compliant across jurisdictions. And, it all hits the books around this time of year.\n\nEmployment Advertising +3K\nAs we continue to grow, we are investing in hiring. This expense reflects the recruiting platform Trevor selected to manage applications and streamline the hiring process. Well worth the cost.\n\nSales Tax Compliance Software +13K\nThis expense represents what we pay Avalara to calculate sales tax on our website and file required sales tax returns. We are reviewing this closely, as we currently spend roughly $45K annually and most of our sales are non-taxable in many states. I hope we see a big credit that I can share in a future summary.\n\nHealth Insurance +5K\nOur provider significantly increased rates, from approximately $13K per month to $18K per month. There are limited alternatives if we want to maintain our current coverage levels.\n\nCorporate Taxes +$58K\nWe operate in many jurisdictions and accrue taxes accordingly. A year-end accrual is recorded to estimate total annual tax obligations, which causes the full amount to hit the books in December."
