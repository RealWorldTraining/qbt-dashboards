# Agent Instructions for qbt-dashboards

## CRITICAL: Always Sync with GitHub

Before making ANY changes to this repository:

```bash
cd /Users/professorx/clawd/qbt-dashboards
git pull origin main
```

After making changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
git push origin main
```

## Required Reading

1. **Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`** — Contains all project paths, sheets, routes, and deployment info
2. **Read `PROFESSOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md`** — System prompt reference for agent configuration

## Key Rules

- **Never work offline** — Always pull before starting, push after finishing
- **Deployment:** Vercel auto-deploys from `main` branch
- **Data source:** ADVERONIX sheet (`1T8PZjlf2vBz7YTlz1GCXe68UczWGL8_ERYuBLd_r6H0`)
- **When renaming UI:** Search the entire codebase for all references
- **Don't modify ADVERONIX sheet structure** without coordinating

## Project Structure

- **Live URL:** https://qbtraining.ai
- **Local path:** /Users/professorx/clawd/qbt-dashboards
- **GitHub:** RealWorldTraining/qbt-dashboards
- **15 reports total** (see PROJECT_CONTEXT.md for full list)

## For New Agents

If you're a new agent (Claude Code, Windsurf, Cursor, etc.):
1. Start by reading this file
2. Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`
3. Run `git pull origin main`
4. Now you're ready to work!

**Bottom line:** Pull first, push last. Every time.
